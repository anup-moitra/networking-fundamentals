## Chapter 1: Introduction to Computer Networking

### What is a Computer Network?

A **computer network** is a collection of devices, such as computers, smartphones, printers, and servers, that are linked together to share information and resources. These devices can be connected either through physical wires like Ethernet cables or wirelessly using Wi-Fi.

### Why Do We Use Networks?

Before computer networks, sharing data between devices was much slower, often relying on physical storage devices like floppy disks, CDs, or USB drives. This process was time-consuming and not efficient, especially over large distances. With networks, information can be shared almost instantly, making it much easier to collaborate and access files, videos, and other resources in real-time.

### Key Components of a Network

1. **Nodes or Hosts**: These are the devices that are connected to the network. This includes computers, smartphones, servers, and other devices.
   
2. **Network Interface Card (NIC)**: This is a hardware component that allows a device to connect to a network. It can be either built into the device or added externally and supports both wired and wireless connections.
   
3. **Communication Media**: These are the pathways that data travels through. Examples include Ethernet cables, fiber optics, and wireless signals like Wi-Fi.

4. **Protocols**: These are the rules that determine how data is sent and received over the network. Some key protocols include:
   - **IP (Internet Protocol)**: This protocol assigns a unique address to each device, allowing it to communicate with other devices.
   - **HTTP/HTTPS**: These are used to access websites and secure web traffic.
   - **DNS (Domain Name System)**: This translates website names (like google.com) into IP addresses so devices can locate the correct websites.

### The Client-Server Model

In networking, devices typically operate using the **client-server model**:
- **Client**: A device that requests a service or resource, like a web browser requesting a website.
- **Server**: A device or system that provides the requested service or resource to the client.

For example, when you watch a video on your phone, your phone (the client) sends a request to a server, which then delivers the video.

### IP Addresses and Port Numbers

Every device on a network is assigned a unique **IP address**. This address helps devices find and communicate with one another. When a device accesses services, it often uses **port numbers** to specify which service it needs. For example, web traffic typically uses port **80** for regular web browsing (HTTP) and port **443** for secure browsing (HTTPS).

### MAC Addresses

A **MAC (Media Access Control) address** is a unique identifier assigned to each device's network interface card (NIC). Unlike an IP address, which can change depending on the network, a MAC address is generally permanent and is used for tasks like network management and security.

### Types of Networks

- **Local Area Network (LAN)**: This network covers a small geographical area, such as a home, office, or building.
- **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: This network spans a large area and connects multiple LANs together, often across cities or countries.
- **The Internet**: The largest and most well-known WAN, connecting millions of networks across the world.

### Summary

Computer networks play a critical role in modern communication. They allow devices to share information quickly and efficiently, making the exchange of data seamless. By understanding basic concepts like the client-server model, IP addressing, and the role of NICs, we can better understand how data is transmitted and accessed in today's interconnected world.
